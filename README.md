# Advent of Code 2024 

This is my advent of code 2024 repo where I attempt to solve things using Perl. 
For most of this, I'm using a few external modules here and there that are mostly
for convenience. 

## Prerequisites

Mojolicious - because using one line to read a file is fun (okay so it's Mojo::File)

List::Util - because list utilities that aren't part of core are also good to have

## How-To use? 

All solutions take a file of data as input (not included in the repository), and
must be ran with the name of the file as parameter. No error checking supplied! 

(e.g. `perl day-1/part-1.pl day-1-part-1-test-data.txt`)
